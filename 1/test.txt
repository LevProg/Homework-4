So carefully the sound of a hasty stream flows through the air, happily running like a winding ribbon among the grasses. As if playing a harp, dewdrops fall from the trees, barely audibly jump onto the flowers, and then silently disappear into the grass. Busy bumblebees are buzzing in the clearing, locusts are singing their simple song. Here and there you can hear the chirping of birds. The tone of everything is set by the quiet rustle of the wind. As a verbal conductor, he directed the murmur of the stream, monitoring the tonality of the dewdrops and periodically calming the network. Lida lies on the soft grass, covering her head from the sun with a large burdock leaf, and enjoys the music of nature. She hasn't heard anything for several years. Hey helps with that memory.
